    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By accessing or using CryptoEats (the "Service"), including our mobile application, website, or API, you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use the Service. We may update these Terms at any time; continued use after changes constitutes acceptance. Material changes will be communicated via email or in-app notification.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>CryptoEats is a marketplace platform connecting users with restaurants for food and alcohol delivery via independent drivers in the Miami, Florida metropolitan area. We facilitate orders, payments (cryptocurrency and traditional fiat), delivery tracking, and customer-driver communication.</p>
    <div class="highlight">
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> CryptoEats does not prepare, sell, or deliver food or alcohol itself. We are a marketplace provider connecting customers with licensed restaurant partners and independent delivery contractors.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Alcohol orders require age verification (21+) in compliance with Florida law (FS 561.57, SB 676). Alcohol may only be delivered between 8:00 AM and 10:00 PM ET, must be in sealed containers, and must be accompanied by food comprising at least 40% of the order's non-alcohol value (FS 565.045).</p>

      <li>Tax is calculated per Florida/Miami-Dade County rates (currently 7% combined: 6% state + 1% county surtax)</li>
      <li>Delivery times are estimates and not guaranteed</li>
      <li>Deliveries are performed by independent contractors, not CryptoEats employees</li>
    </ul>
