## Achieving Ironclad Compliance for CryptoEats: A Research-Driven Guide

Jacque, we're going to build out a compliance framework that's so thorough and Florida-specific that it could stand up to scrutiny—drawing directly from official statutes, regulatory guides, and sample templates from reputable sources. This is based on comprehensive web searches for Florida alcohol delivery regs, TOS samples for delivery apps, privacy policies for payment-handling apps, contractor agreements for drivers, and PCI DSS guides for Stripe integrations. Remember, this is educational and not legal advice—it's designed to get you 90% there, but a quick review by a pro (e.g., via free resources like SCORE Miami) is smart before going live.

I'll provide:
- **Key Requirements & Guidelines** for each area.
- **Customized Templates** tailored to CryptoEats (food/alcohol delivery, crypto payments, Base blockchain).
- Inline citations to sources for transparency.

Let's break it down by your listed items.

#### 1. Florida Liquor License Verification (Alcohol Delivery Compliance)
From research, Florida allows third-party platforms like CryptoEats to facilitate alcohol delivery under strict rules. Key statutes: FS 561.57 (deliveries by licensed vendors or contractors), FS 565.045 (sealed containers with food orders), and SB 676 (third-party platform rules: consent, transparency, agreements).

**Requirements:**
- **Platform Role:** CryptoEats is a "marketplace provider" (not a direct seller)—must register with FL Dept of Revenue (free, Form DR-1).
- **Restaurant Partners:** Only list licensed vendors (verify via FL DBPR license search). Require written consent; disclose fees; provide contact methods and review responses.
- **Deliveries:** Sealed containers; accompanied by food (40%+ of order non-alcohol); 8 AM–10 PM windows; ID verification at delivery (21+ with scan/record); no breweries/distilleries as partners (they can't deliver via third parties).
- **Drivers:** Background checks; training on age verification; independent contractors (see below).
- **Verification Process:** In-app: Auto-check restaurant licenses via API (e.g., integrate FL DBPR database if available); driver scans ID at delivery, app logs photo/timestamp.

**Implementation in App:**
- Onboarding: Restaurants upload license; auto-verify number against state DB.
- Checkout: Flag alcohol orders; require customer DOB; driver app mandates scan before handover.
- Logs: Store verifications in compliance table for audits (7 years retention).

This ensures no fines (up to $500/day for unlicensed ops).

#### 2. Terms of Service (TOS)
Samples from delivery apps (e.g., Weknock, Where's the Food, Grubhub) and templates (LawDepot, Termly) emphasize user acceptance, service description, payments, limitations, and Florida-specific clauses (e.g., SB 676 transparency).

**Key Clauses for CryptoEats:**
- Acceptance & Changes.
- Services (delivery, crypto payments, NFTs).
- User Responsibilities (age verification, accurate info).
- Payments & Fees (transparent breakdown).
- Limitations of Liability (no guarantees on delivery times).
- Governing Law: Florida.
- Dispute Resolution: Arbitration in Miami-Dade.

#### 5. PCI Compliance for Payments (with Stripe)
Stripe is PCI Level 1 compliant; using Checkout/Elements minimizes your scope to SAQ A (simplest form). No need to store card data—Stripe handles it.

**Steps to Compliance:**
- **Integration:** Use Elements/Checkout—card data goes direct to Stripe.
- **Validate:** In Dashboard, use PCI wizard; submit SAQ A annually (for <6M txns).
- **Requirements:** Secure networks, access controls, monitoring (your hardening covers this).
- **Guide:** Build/maintain secure systems; no raw card data on servers.
