Great question. Yes, right now CryptoEats is a functional MVP/demo.
It has the full user experience mapped out — browsing, ordering, checkout, driver mode, onboarding, admin tools — but there are several areas that would need real implementation to make it production-ready. Here's a breakdown:

What's Working Now (MVP)
Full customer app (browse restaurants, cart, checkout, order tracking UI)
Driver app (accept orders, earnings, support)
Merchant & driver onboarding flows
Admin dashboard
Database with seeded restaurant/menu data
Authentication (JWT login/signup)
Tax calculation engine (Florida/Miami-Dade compliant)
Open Platform API structure (API keys, webhooks, developer portal)
What's Needed for Production
1. Real Payment Processing

The checkout currently simulates payment. You'd need a real payment processor (like Stripe) integrated to actually charge (Stripe is Optional) customers' cards and handle refunds.
For crypto payments (USDC/escrow), the blockchain contracts would need to be deployed on Base mainnet with real wallet connections. ( We Just Updated This, also we have Coinbase Commerce API and CDP API Keys for crypto payments & Onramper)

2. Real-Time Location & Mapping

Driver tracking currently uses simulated coordinates. Production needs real GPS tracking from driver devices and a mapping service (like Google Maps) for route calculations and live delivery tracking.
3. Push Notifications

Order updates, driver assignments, and delivery alerts need real push notification delivery to users' phones (via a service like Expo's push notification system).

4. Email & SMS Verification

Account verification, password resets, and order confirmations need a real email/SMS service (like Twilio or SendGrid).
5. Image Uploads & Storage

Restaurant photos, menu item images, and driver documents (license, insurance) currently use placeholder URLs. Production needs real file storage for uploads.
6. Identity Verification

Age verification for alcohol and driver background checks need integration with a real identity verification service.
7. Security Hardening

Rate limiting tuning, input sanitization review, HTTPS enforcement, and security audits.
Proper secret rotation and environment-specific configuration.
8. Scaling & Performance

Database indexing optimization, connection pooling, caching layer (Redis), and load testing.
CDN for static assets and images.
9. Legal & Compliance

Real Florida liquor license verification
Terms of service, privacy policy, and contractor agreements reviewed by legal counsel
PCI compliance for payment processing
10. Monitoring & Error Tracking

Production error tracking, performance monitoring, and alerting systems.
Logging infrastructure for debugging production issues.

Payment processing — can't take real orders without it
Email/SMS — needed for account verification and order confirmations
Image storage — so restaurants can upload real photos
Push notifications — so customers and drivers get real-time updates
Maps & GPS tracking — for real delivery routing and live tracking
Identity verification — required for alcohol compliance
Security audit & monitoring — before opening to real users
